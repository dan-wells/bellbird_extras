The license of voice files depends on the origins of these voices.
We give in turn the origin and license terms of each voice file.

The script HTS_multi2single.py is licensed GPLv2+. For interoperability
we studied the Festival and hts_engine sources to determine the input
and output data structures to convert multi-file HTS voices to single-file
HTS voices.

The voice file licenses are:

cmu_us_slt_arctic.htsvoice

This voice is from hts_engine distribution from the
file :hts_voice_cmu_us_arctic_slt-1.05.tar.gz
This file has not been altered from the version in the hts_engine distribution.
This voice is derived from CMU ARCTIC database and has the
CMU ARCTIC license as given at the end of this document and
also the HTS license given here:
