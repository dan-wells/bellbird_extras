Bellbird: extras
================

This is a repository of various extra scripts and voice files used
in testing Bellbird. A diverse range of publicly released voice files
from many different sources are collected to facilitate testing of Bellbird.

The origins and license terms of extras used in Bellbird testing are found in
the COPYING file. Apart from format changes we do not modify the voice data
since the purpose is to test compatibility.
